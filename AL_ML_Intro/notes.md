## AI ML

* AL: MAchine that mimics human intelligence and behavior
* ML: Machine that learns froom the data automatically w.r.t a particular task and performance measure
* Deep Learning: Subset of ML, learning happens via algorithms inspired by neural networks in human brain. Espcially for non-linear data
* Generative AL: Subset of DL, creating new content from existing ones using advanced algorithms.
* Data Science: Using AI toi enable data driven decision making
