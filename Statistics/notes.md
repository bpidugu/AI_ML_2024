## Basic Statistics

- Statistics is the science of learning from Data
- Data are numbers with a context

## Exploring Data
- Any set of data contains information about some group of **individuals**.
- The characteristics we measure on each individual are called **variables**.
- **Categorical Variable**: places an individual into one of several groups or categories.
- **Quantitative Variable**: takes numerical values for which it takes sense to find an average.
- **Distribution**: Distribution of a variable tells us what values the variable takes and how often it takes these values.

### Analyzing Categorical Data
- Bar Graphs & Pie Charts, Segmented Bar graph, 
- Measure: Frequency, Relative Frequency
- **Marginal Distribution**: The margical distribution of one of the categorical variables in a two-way table of counts is the distrbution of values of that variable among all individuals described by the table.
- **Conditional Distribution**: A conditional distribution of a variable describes the values of that varaible among individuals who have a specific value of another variable. There is a separate conditional distrbution of each value of other varaible.
- **Association**: There is an association between two variables - if knowing the value of one variable helps predict the value of the other.
  
### Analyzing Quantitiative Data
- Dotplots, Stemplot, Histogram
- Measure: shape,center, spread, outliers (SOCS)
- **Outliers**: an individual value that falls outside the overall pattern.
- **Symmetric Distrbution**: if the right and left sides of the graph are approx. mirror images of each other.
- **Skewed to RIGHT**: if the right side of the graph is much longer than the left side.
- **Skewed to the LEFT**: if the left side of the graph is much longer than the right side. 
### Describing Quantitative Data with Numbers:

- **Mean**: Sum of observations/n
- **Median**: Midpoint of a distribution.
- Mean and median are same for symmetric distribution
- **Measuring Spread**:  Range and Interquartile Range(IQR). IQR = Q3 (third quartile) - Q1 (first quartile). Q3 - median of the observations that are to the right of the median. Q1 - median of the observations that are to left of the median.
