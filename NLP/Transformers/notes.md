### Attention Mechanism and Transformers

- In self-attention, each attention weight signifies the importance or relevance of a token in the context of the entire sequence, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input when making predictions.
-  In multi-head attention, each attention head independently computes attention weights for the input sequence.
-  In multi-head attention, each attention head independently computes attention weights for the input sequence.
-  Having multiple attention heads allows the model to capture different aspects or patterns in the data, enhancing its capacity to learn diverse relationships within the input sequence.
-   It combines the output of the self-attention mechanism with the original input (Add), followed by normalization (Norm).
-   In the context of the Transformer decoder, during masked attention, only the words before the target word in the sequence are considered, excluding the target word itself and any future words. In the given sentence, if masked attention is applied to the word "generates," the attention score would be calculated by considering only the words before it, which are "In," "the," "realm," "of," "machine," "translation," "the," "Transformer," "decoder."
-   Masked multi-head attention is part of the decoder block in the transformer model.
-   In the Transformer decoder's multi-head attention mechanism, the keys and values are obtained from the encoder's output. This allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence while generating each element of the output sequence.
-   The correct approach for training and fine-tuning a transformer is typically to pre-train the model on a large and diverse corpus of text (a broad corpus) and then fine-tune it for a specific task. This allows the model to learn general language patterns during pre-training and then adapt to the specifics of the target task during fine-tuning. 
-   Generating a paragraph from a textual description can be efficiently handled by unimodal transformers. Tasks like generating an image, a video, or audio from a textual description inherently involve multiple modalities, making them suitable for multi-modal transformers capable of processing both text and visual or auditory data. Multi-modal transformers excel in tasks requiring a comprehensive understanding of information from various sources, offering a unified approach to tasks involving different modalities concurrently.
-   The input to the function is a list of two sentences. Each sentence is embedded into a vector and we are calculating the cosine similarity between the vectors. As the two sentences are the same, we find the cosine similarity between a vector (say v) and itself. Since the angle between the vectors is 0, the cosine similarity score is 1.
-   new_arr = np.argsort(score_vector)[::-1][:k]
This snippet of code will work as follows

np.argsort will sort the score_vector (an array containing the cosine similarity scores) in ascending order and return the indices of the elements
[::-1] will reverse the output from the previous step
[:k] will select the first k values from the output of the previous step
If the cosine score between a query text and the target text is high, we say they are similar. Since the scores are arranged in ascending order and the top k values are fetched, we get the indices of the top k most similar sentences.
- The parameter max_length determines the maximum length of the generated sequence. In the provided code, max_length is set to 300, which means the generated sequence should not exceed 300 tokens.
- When the temperature value of a generative model is set high, it increases the randomness of the generated outputs. A higher temperature encourages more diverse and creative responses by softening the probability distribution over the possible choices, leading to a broader range of generated samples.

### FAQ


1. How does the following function work?
def cosine_score(text):
    embeddings = model.encode(text)

    norm1 = np.linalg.norm(embeddings[0])
    norm2 = np.linalg.norm(embeddings[1])

    cosine_similarity_score = ((np.dot(embeddings[0],embeddings[1]))/(norm1*norm2))

    return cosine_similarity_score
To understand how the function works, let's go over the function one line at a time.

def cosine_score(text):
This line defines a Python function named cosine_score that takes a single parameter text, which is a list or array of two sentences.

embeddings = model.encode(text)
Here, the input text is passed to the encode() method of the model instance (which is assumed to be a SentenceTransformer model). This method converts the input text into numerical embeddings (vectors) using pre-trained models designed for generating sentence embeddings. The result is stored in the variable embeddings.

norm1 = np.linalg.norm(embeddings[0])
norm2 = np.linalg.norm(embeddings[1])
These lines calculate the Euclidean norms (magnitudes) of the vectors in embeddings. embeddings is assumed to be a list or array with at least two elements, and the norms of the first and second elements are stored in norm1 and norm2, respectively.

cosine_similarity_score = ((np.dot(embeddings[0], embeddings[1])) / (norm1 * norm2))
This line calculates the cosine similarity score between the two vectors in embeddings. It is computed by taking the dot product of the vectors and dividing it by the product of their Euclidean norms. This normalization accounts for differences in the magnitudes of the vectors.

return cosine_similarity_score
Finally, the function returns the computed cosine similarity score.

 

2. How does the following function work?
def top_k_similar_sentences(embedding_matrix,query_text,k):
    query_embedding = model.encode(query_text)

    score_vector = np.dot(embedding_matrix,query_embedding)

    top_k_indices = np.argsort(score_vector)[::-1][:k]

    return data.loc[list(top_k_indices), 'review']
To understand how the function works, let's go over the function one line at a time.

def top_k_similar_sentences(embedding_matrix, query_text, k):
This line defines a function named top_k_similar_sentences that takes three parameters:

embedding_matrix: A matrix containing embeddings of sentences
query_text: The input query for which we want to find similar sentences
k: The number of top similar sentences to retrieve
query_embedding = model.encode(query_text)
In this line, the function uses the encode() method of a SentenceTransformer instance (model) to convert the input query_text into a numerical vector (query_embedding). This vector represents the semantic content of the input text.

score_vector = np.dot(embedding_matrix, query_embedding)
Here, the function calculates the cosine similarity between the query_embedding vector and all other vectors in the embedding_matrix. The dot product operation (np.dot) results in a vector (score_vector) where each element represents the cosine similarity score between the query and the corresponding sentence in the dataset.

top_k_indices = np.argsort(score_vector)[::-1][:k]
This line sorts the score_vector in ascending order using np.argsort and then reverses the order ([::-1]). The result is an array of indices indicating the positions of the most similar sentences in the dataset, arranged in descending order of similarity scores. The first k indices are selected, representing the top k most similar sentences.

return data.loc[list(top_k_indices), 'review']
Finally, the function returns the 'review' column values from the dataset corresponding to the top k indices. This provides the actual text of the top k most similar sentences to the input query, based on their cosine similarity scores.
