## Generative AI

- AI: Artificial Intelligence is the broader field that encompasses the development of computer sytems capable of human-like intelligence.
- AI: {Machine Learning :{Superised, Unsupervised},Deep Learning:{LLM, Gen AI}}
- Supervised Learning predicts; involves training a ML model on labeled data with known outcomes
- Unsupervised Learning understands patterns; involves finding patterns and structures in data without labeled  outcomes.
- **Deep Learning**: DL is a subfield of ML that involves training artifical neural networks with many layers(deep neural networks) to perform tasks such as image and speech recognition. 
- **GenAI**: GenAI refers to AI models capable of generating new content, such as text, images, which are often indistinguishable from human-created content.
- **Transformers** are a class of deep learning models widely used for tasks like natural language understanding and generation, known for their self-attention mechanism.
- Large Language Models: **BERT, GPT**
- **GANs**(Generative Adversarial Networks) are a class of ML framework and generative models that can be generate new examples from a given training dataset.
- Vision Transformers - **CLIP, DALL-E**

## Supervised & UnSupervised Learning
- Supervised learning involves training a model using labeled examples, where the input data is paired with the corresponding correct output. The primary goal is to build a model that can accurately map inputs to their respective predefined categories or classes.
 - Unsupervised learning aims to uncover patterns, structure, and relationships within a dataset without using labeled output. One common objective is to cluster similar data points together, which helps in identifying inherent structures or groupings within the data.

  ## Distriminative AI vs Generative AI
  - Dis.AI - Learns from relationship between labels and data
  - Classification is ML task that involves categorizing data point into predefined classes or categories based on their features.
-  Dis.AI refers to systems in AI that primarily focus on classification tasks, making predictions based on input data, often using techniques like logistic regression or deep learning.
-  Gen.AI can be used for creating realistic human-like text, even though it hasn't passed the Turing test.
